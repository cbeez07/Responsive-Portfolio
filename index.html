      <h1>About Me</h1>

      <img src="assets/images/ProfilePic.jpg" class="auth-image" alt="Your Name">

      <p>After growing up on a farm in Western Kansas, I left Kansas. In the seven years after school I worked in all types of industries, mostly working with hardware, programming PLCs and auditing food-manufacturing plants. During that time I was able to work with people, and in factories all over the country. In my personal life, I married my now wife of almost eight years, we moved from Indiana to Illinois for her school and finally moved to Oregon when she graduated from Vet-Med school and got a job in Salem Oregon.</p>

      <p>I found a job working for Tokyo Electron America, working in the Semi-Conductor industry. I worked on Photolithography tools on Intelâ€™s Ronler Acres campus. After living in Oregon for a couple of years my wife and I decided to have kids, and had twin boys. Since my wife and I did not grow up around our grandparents, we decided to move back to the mid-west, so our kids could grow up around their grandparents, and cousins. </p>

      <p>One thing that I am very proud of during my last two jobs has been my ability to work my way up in both of the companies. My first company was a small company and I started out as a temp and worked my way up to being in charge of all the PLCs across the US. In my second job, I worked for a very large company and after a year and a half I became the technical lead for our shift. Now that we have moved back to Kansas, I have decided to pursue my dream of becoming a web-designer/programmer.</p>
